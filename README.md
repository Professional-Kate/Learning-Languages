# Learning-Languages
There are **Quite** a few languages that look really interesting to me and because of that I want to learn them! 

Before this repo, I made a seperate repo for each language. One for Python, C# and JavaScript - but this would eventually get very messy because I want to learn a lot of languages. 

That's what this repository is for. A collection of every langauge I've learnt / am learning. 

## Want To Learn

These are the langauges I want to learn, adding them here for some accountability.
